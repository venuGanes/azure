# Lab scenario

My organization is setting up a new training environment for onboarding new software developers. This environment will be used to practice deploying and troubleshooting cloud-based applications. Several trainers and mentors will be assigned to oversee the training labs, including managing the cloud resources. To allow them to sign in securely using Microsoft Entra ID, I have been tasked with creating and configuring the necessary user accounts and role-based groups. To reduce manual management, I will configure the groups so that membership updates automatically based on each userâ€™s department and role.
