# Lab scenario

Your organization is currently storing data in on-premises data stores. Most of these files are not accessed frequently. 
You would like to minimize the cost of storage by placing infrequently accessed files in lower-priced storage tiers. 
ou also plan to explore different protection mechanisms that Azure Storage offers, including network access, authentication, authorization, and replication.
Finally, you want to determine to what extent Azure Files is suitable for hosting your on-premises file shares.
